1. List 3 examples of a real world queue.
    - IT Ticket System
    - Kitchen Order Requests
    - A line of people waiting to get a signature from a famous person

2. List 3 examples of a real world stack.
    - A stack of papers that need to be signed
    - A stack of plates to be cleaned
    - A list of undo caches in a software

3. If a piece of software passes all of its unit tests does it necessarily work correctly? Why or why not?
    It does not, you can never fully prepare for every situtation (unless the software is really really simple). 

4. Why is a linked list better than a fixed-size array for implementing stacks and queues?
    A linked list is better because it can have more elements than a fixed-size array. Also, since you only need to access the front and back elements
    of the stack and queue, a linked list with a head and tail pointer will have the same efficiency as an array.
